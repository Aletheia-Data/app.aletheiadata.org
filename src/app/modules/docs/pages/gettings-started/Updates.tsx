          Like all HTML templates, you will need to manually handle all updates
          that we provide after purchase for free. The best practice is to
          always keep {REACT_APP_THEME_NAME}'s source folder on an entire separate folder
          within your project and then use {REACT_APP_THEME_NAME} as a development
          companion or support.

        <div className="py-4">
          Each update should be used independently without mixing it with the
          previous versions. This is because new updates may not have a 100%
          backward compatibility for elements within previous versions.
          Therefore, each update is considered as a new and better version of
          the theme.

          If something goes wrong, you can revert your updates by reusing your
          backup files.
